**1-isdigit.c:** Writing a function that checks for a digit (0 through 9).


**2-mul.c:** Writing a function that multiplies two integers.


**3-print_numbers.c:** Writing a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.


**4-print_most_numbers.c:** Writing a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.


**5-more_numbers.c:** Writing a function that prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line.

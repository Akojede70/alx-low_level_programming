main.h: The main.h contains the prototype of each file and the header


0-main.c: This file test the function positive_or_negative() gives the correct output when given a case of 0.


1-main.c: I Comment out the (donâ€™t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.


2-largest_number.c: Fixing the code so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.


3-print_remaining_days.c: Fixing the function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.
